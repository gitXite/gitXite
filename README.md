# Hi, I'm Daniel â€” an aspiring full-stack software developer!

## ðŸ›  My Journey
I began coding in 2024 and quickly discovered a deep passion for building real-world projects. Since then, Iâ€™ve spent my spare time learning and improving every day, focusing on both frontend and backend development.

In autumn 2025, Iâ€™ll begin a bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Engineering at HÃ¸gskulen pÃ¥ Vestlandet in Bergen, Norway.

## ðŸ§  Skills & Technologies
Currently learning and working with:
- JavaScript â€¢ TypeScript
- Python â€¢ C â€¢ Go
- SQL & PostgreSQL
- Node.js / Express
- React â€¢ Vite
- Git & GitHub

## ðŸš€ What I'm Working On
I'm building HANDL, a full-stack web app focused on:
- Authentication & session management (Passport.js)
- RESTful API design
- Responsive UI & clean UX
- Real-time updates with Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- Deployment & hosting (launch coming soon!)

I aim to write clean, maintainable code and follow best practices while finding practical solutions.

## ðŸ“š Learning Philosophy
I learn by building. Iâ€™m not afraid to take on difficult challenges â€” in fact, I thrive on them. I believe the higher the skill cap, the more rewarding the journey. Iâ€™m committed to putting in the time and effort to improve, one project at a time.

Resources Iâ€™ve used:
- Boot.dev
- CS50 (Harvard)
- The Odin Project
- Udemy Courses

## ðŸ’¡ What Drives Me
I'm motivated by solving problems, continuous improvement, and seeing ideas come to life through code. Each project teaches me something new â€” from writing better logic to structuring apps and designing interfaces.

Iâ€™m curious, driven, and always striving to push myself forward.
