# Hi, I'm Daniel — an aspiring full-stack software developer!

## 🗺️ My Journey
I began coding in 2024 and quickly discovered a deep passion for building real-world projects. Since then, I’ve spent my spare time learning and improving every day, focusing on both frontend and backend development.

In autumn 2025, I’ll begin a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Høgskulen på Vestlandet in Bergen, Norway.

## 🛠 Skills & Technologies
Currently learning and working with:
- JavaScript • TypeScript
- Python • C • Go
- SQL & PostgreSQL
- Node.js / Express
- React • Vite
- Git & GitHub

## 🚀 What I'm Working On
### HANDL
I'm building HANDL, a full-stack web app that helps users create, manage, and share shopping lists in real time. Whether you're planning groceries solo or coordinating with family, HANDL keeps everything in sync across devices. 

I'm focused on:
- Authentication & session management (Passport.js)
- RESTful API design
- Responsive UI & clean UX
- Real-time updates with Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- Deployment & hosting (launch coming soon!)

I aim to write clean, maintainable code and follow best practices while finding practical solutions.

## 📚 Learning Philosophy
I learn by building. I’m not afraid to take on difficult challenges — in fact, I thrive on them. I believe the higher the skill cap, the more rewarding the journey. I’m committed to putting in the time and effort to improve, one project at a time.

Resources I’ve used:
- Boot.dev
- CS50 (Harvard)
- The Odin Project
- Udemy Courses

## 💡 What Drives Me
I'm motivated by solving problems, continuous improvement, and seeing ideas come to life through code. Each project teaches me something new — from writing better logic to structuring apps and designing interfaces.

I’m curious, driven, and always striving to push myself forward.
