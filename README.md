# Hi I'm Daniel, an aspiring full-stack software developer!

## My journey
I began my journey in software development back in 2024 and quickly discovered a deep passion for building projects with code. 
Since then, I've been dedicating my spare time to learning and improving every day, focusing on both frontend and backend development. 
In the autumn of 2025, I'll be starting my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Høgskulen på Vestlandet in Bergen, Norway. 

## Skills & Technologies
I've learnt and continuing to explore:
- Javascript and Typescript
- Python
- C
- Go
- SQL and PostgreSQL
- Node.js/Express
- Git
- React
- Vite

## What I'm working on
### Currently, I'm building HANDL
A full-stack web application that reflects real-world use cases, focusing on authentication, RESTful API design, responsive UIs, and real-time features. 
My goal is to write clean and maintainable code, focusing on best practises in addition to finding the best solution for the task at hand. 
I'm also exploring:
- React and modern UI/UX principles
- Node.js/Express with PostgreSQL for backend development
- Real-time features with Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- Secure authentication using Passport and session-based systems
- Deployment and hosting (planning to go live with my app soon!)

### Learning
I'm learning by doing, making real projects, and I'm not afraid to build something because it's hard. 
I've always found solice in learning something difficult, and for me, the higher the skill cap the more I pursue. 
I'm not afraid of spending hundreds or even thousands of hours to become the best that I can be, I enjoy the grind. 
Some of the resources I've used:
- Boot.dev
- Udemy
- CS50
- The Odin Project

## What drives me
I'm deeply motivated by problem-solving and continuous improvement. 
Every project teaches me something new, whether it's writing more efficient code, understanding performance trade-offs, or improving my UI design skills. 
I'm also learning how to work independently, structuring codebases, managing project timelines and debugging complex issues. 
I'm committed, curious, and always striving to push my skills to the next level.
